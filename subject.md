# Tech Challenge - Full Stack Engineer

As we move forward in the hiring process, we’d like to assess your skills by asking you to complete this technical challenge.

At Kyros, we’re looking for an engineer who thrives in a startup environment and who is not afraid to turn ideas into live features for DeFi users.

## Challenge

The challenge is composed of two parts. First, we ask you to build a small Solana program replicating a vault mechanism. Second, we’d like you to build a frontend to let users connect to the dApp and interact with the vault.

### Vault

Here are the main requirements of what we are looking for:

- Deposit
    - Takes a token as deposit token and mints the right amount of IOU
- Two-Step Withdrawal
    - Step 1: Request withdrawal
    - Step 2: Claim withdrawal at the next epoch
- Increase rate
    - Use this function to simulate as if the vault accrued some rewards, increasing the IOU value

Feel free to work around those!

### Frontend

- Deposit tokens
- Request withdrawal
- Claim withdrawal

The above can be deployed on Solana Devnet. Please attach to your submission:

- The source code of the vault and the frontend
- The deployed address of the vault
- A transaction showing a deposit
- A transaction showing an increase in rate
- A transaction showing a withdrawal request
- A transaction showing a withdrawal claim

## Open Questions

We strongly believe that AI can help you ship better and faster and are encouraging its use for the challenge and the day-to-day work at Kyros.

- If you used AI for the challenge, can you share your favorite tools? (LLMs, IDEs, models you use when coding, …)
- Do you think AI could fully vibe code new features without much supervision from a dev?
- What limitations do you see to vibe coding?

We’re looking forward to your submission and feel free to let us know if you have any comments or questions!
